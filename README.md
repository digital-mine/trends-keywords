# trends-keywords
Python code that interacts with google trends


This is a very simple python script I used to extract keywords to find the tranding topic for new pubications.

It works with pytrends library, and take into consideration the last 7 days rising keywords.

It can be used with a list of different topics, and it print out the most popular titles you should use for each topic you chose.
